### Model Deployment using the Streamlit App

### Files
- **`app.py`**: 
  - The main Python script that serves as the Streamlit application.
  - Provides an interactive UI to users for inputting data and visualizing model predictions.
  - Loads the trained machine learning pipeline and uses it to generate predictions.
  - Includes functionality for displaying results or visualizations derived from the model.

- **`trained_pipeline.pkl`**: 
  - A serialized file containing the trained machine learning pipeline (preprocessing steps + model).
  - Created during the model training phase and used here to ensure consistency in predictions.

### Workflow
1. **Model Training and Serialization**:
   - A machine learning pipeline was trained and saved as `trained_pipeline.pkl` using `pickle`.
   - The pipeline includes all necessary preprocessing steps and a sample trained model, that later can be updated to a production model.

2. **Streamlit App (`app.py`)**:
   - Loads the `trained_pipeline.pkl` file at runtime.
   - Accepts user inputs (e.g., via text boxes, sliders, or file uploads).
   - Processes the inputs using the loaded pipeline.
   - Displays predictions and any additional analysis in an easy-to-use web interface.

3. **Running the App**:
   - Start the Streamlit app by running the following command in the terminal:
     ```bash
     streamlit run app.py
     ```
   - The app will open in the browser, where users can interact with it by providing inputs and viewing predictions.
